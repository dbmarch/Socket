# Socket Classes

Socket classes which provide same behavior as the linux calls 
They handle
  Remembering socket parameters
  Provide the glue for the various addressing


Examples

Server  
  This will just open a TCP socket, listen , accept
  It expects a client to connecdt, sent a message and it will reply back with the message
  It will close once the client shuts down

 Server2
  This will just open a TCP socket, listen  and launch a thread for accept

  The accept thread will loop through this behavior:
  It expects a client to connecdt, sent a message and it will reply back with the message
  It will close that new socket once the client shuts down and then go back and accept again.

Server3
  Launches Receive threads from accept threads.  
  2 accept threads launched.   
  Looking at how to scale a socket spawing with receive handlers.

Server4 
  A class launches an accept thread and receive thread.
  
Client
  Connect to the test servers

  Sends message, receives message and exits
